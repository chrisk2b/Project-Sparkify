# Purpose of the Repository

This repository contains the results of the Data Science Nanodegree Sparkify Capstone Project. Itsâ€™s purpose is to give the reviewers of the access to the code.

# Summary of the Sparkify Project

Sparkify is a fictional music provider just like Spotify. In the Project, we analyse event data of Sparkify users. The data is given in terms of an event log which records events such as to which songs users are listening, are they adding friends or are they downgrading from paid to a free account etc. We work only on a tiny subset (128MB) of the full dataset available (12GB) since the analysis is done locally. The goal is to predict customer churn. Spark is used for the analysis in order to be able to scale well once the data of Sparkify exceeds the capacities to be analyzed on a single machine.

# Data
